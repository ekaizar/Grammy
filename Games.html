    <h1>Birthday Party Game Plan</h1>

    <div class="original-prompt">
        <strong>The Goal:</strong> "I am throwing a birthday party for a 10 year old girl and her 12 year old sister and 15 year old brother. I need ideas for games that the whole family can play together and are unlikely to start an argument."
    </div>

    <h2>Category 1: The "Peacekeepers" (Low Conflict)</h2>
    <p><em>Games designed to minimize arguments through collaboration or pure luck.</em></p>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>1. The "Paper Telephone" Game (Telestrations) <span class="tag">Collaborative</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Everyone sits in a circle with a stack of paper. Person A writes a phrase (e.g., "A cat driving a taco truck"). Person B looks at it, flips the page, and draws it. Person C looks at the drawing (without seeing the phrase), flips the page, and guesses what it is in words.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> No winners or losers, just hilarious misunderstandings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>2. The Saran Wrap Ball Game <span class="tag">High Energy</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Create a massive ball of saran wrap with prizes layered inside (candy, money, gift cards). One person unrolls the ball to get prizes while the person to their right rolls a pair of dice trying to get doubles. Once doubles are rolled, the ball is passed.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Everyone wins something (candy for the 10yo, money for the 15yo).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>3. Left Center Right (LCR) <span class="tag">Pure Luck</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Using 3 dice and 3 tokens (or dollars) per person. Roll the dice: "Left" passes a token left, "Right" passes right, "Center" puts it in the pot. The last person with a token wins the pot.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Zero skill involved, so siblings can't argue about fairness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>4. The "Blind Taste Test" Challenge <span class="tag">Sensory</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Blindfold players and have them guess flavors. Can be soda brands (Coke vs Pepsi), chip flavors, or weird combinations for the brave.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>Category 2: Active & Silly</h2>
    <p><em>Physical games that level the playing field between ages.</em></p>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>5. "Minute to Win It" Challenges <span class="tag">Fast Paced</span></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cookie Face:</strong> Move a cookie from forehead to mouth using only facial muscles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cup Stacking:</strong> Stack and unstack a pyramid of cups in under 60 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Junk in the Trunk:</strong> Shake 8 ping pong balls out of a tissue box tied to your waist.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>6. The Oven Mitt Challenge <span class="tag">Slapstick</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> A player wears thick oven mitts and tries to unwrap a tightly taped gift. To add pressure, another player rolls dice next to them; they must pass the mitts when doubles are rolled.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>7. The "Hallway Laser" Maze <span class="tag">Solo Challenge</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Tape streamers or yarn across a hallway like spy lasers. Players must navigate through without breaking the tape. Time them for a personal best.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>8. "Defy Gravity" (Balloon Keep-Up) <span class="tag">Cooperative</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The family must keep 3 balloons in the air simultaneously. The rule: You cannot touch the same balloon twice in a row (you must hit a different one, or someone else must hit it).</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>Category 3: Word & Guessing Games</h2>
    <p><em>Games that rely on wit, creativity, or inside jokes.</em></p>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>9. "The Bowl Game" (Celebrity) <span class="tag">Teamwork</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Players write nouns on slips of paper and put them in a bowl. Played in 3 rounds using the same slips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Describe the word using any other words.</li>
            <li><strong>Round 2:</strong> Describe the word using only ONE word.</li>
            <li><strong>Round 3:</strong> Act it out (Charades).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>10. "Just One" (DIY Version) <span class="tag">Cooperative</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> One person guesses. Everyone else writes one-word clues. <strong>Crucial Rule:</strong> If two clue-givers write the same word, those clues are erased. The guesser only sees the unique clues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>11. Reverse Charades <span class="tag">Team Acting</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Instead of one person acting for the team, the <strong>entire team acts</strong> out the word for one person to guess. Great for getting the siblings to work together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>12. "Caveman" (Poetry for Neanderthals) <span class="tag">Silly</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Explain a complex word using only single-syllable words. If you use a big word, the other team gets to hit you with a pillow/inflatable bat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>13. Motion Telephone (Silent Charades) <span class="tag">Physical Comedy</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Players stand in a line facing forward. The back person sees a prompt (e.g., "Washing a cat"), taps the person in front, and acts it out. That person taps the next, and mimics what they saw. The last person guesses the original prompt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>14. "Fictionary" (The Definition Game) <span class="tag">Bluffing</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The reader finds an obscure word in the dictionary. Everyone else writes a fake definition. The reader reads the real one and the fakes. Players score points for guessing the right one AND for tricking people into voting for their fake one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-block">
        <h3>15. Smartphone Photo Scavenger Hunt <span class="tag">Creative</span></h3>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Give players a list of abstract prompts ("Something rounder than an orange," "A selfie with a pet"). Set a timer for 10 minutes. Meet back to share photos on the TV.</p>
